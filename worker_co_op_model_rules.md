43. Transmittees do not have the right to attend or vote at a general meeting, a meeting of the Equity Shareholders, or agree to a proposed written resolution, in respect of Equity Shares to which they are entitled, by reason of the holder’s death or bankruptcy or otherwise, unless they become the holder of the Equity Shares.

      **Exercise of transmittees’ rights**  
44. Transmittees who wish to become the holders of Equity Shares to which they have become entitled must notify the Co-operative in Writing of that wish. If the transmittee wishes to have an Equity Share transferred to another Person, the transmittee must execute an instrument of transfer in respect of it. Any transfer made or executed under this Article is to be treated as if it were made or executed by the Person from whom the transmittee has derived rights in respect of that Equity Share, and as if the event which gave rise to the transmission had not occurred.

      **Transmittees bound by prior notices**  
45. If a notice is given to an Equity Shareholder in respect of Equity Shares and a transmittee is entitled to those Equity Shares, the transmittee is bound by the notice if it was given to the Equity Shareholder before the transmittee’s name has been entered in the register of Members.
